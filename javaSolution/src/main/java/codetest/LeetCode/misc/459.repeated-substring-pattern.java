 * Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a
 * substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You
 * may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and
 * its length will not exceed 10000.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "abab"

 * Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:

 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "abcabcabcabc"
 * Output: True
 * Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring
 * "abcabc" twice.)
